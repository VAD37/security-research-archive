# User can steal other people brain model by copy/paste ipfs link. There is no copyright protection

Fighter NFT brain model IPFS hash link can be updated anytime by NFT owner.
This information is public.

All user have to do copy paste model hash of top ranking leaderboard and update their NFT brain model.

## Impact

Allow easy cheating by thief other people brain model.
All I need to do look at top leaderboard and copy paste their model hash.

## Proof of Concept

User can update model anytime.

```solidity
    function updateModel(
        uint256 tokenId, 
        string calldata modelHash,
        string calldata modelType
    ) 
        external
    {
        require(msg.sender == ownerOf(tokenId));
        fighters[tokenId].modelHash = modelHash;//@audit M there is nothing to stop user to use someone else model fighting for them. As all modelHash and type is public. There need to be some offchain verification purpose
        fighters[tokenId].modelType = modelType;
        numTrained[tokenId] += 1;
        totalNumTrained += 1;
    }
```

Assuming game server just getting model from database. There is no way to verify if model is really belong to NFT owner.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Implement copyright protection.

```solidity
    function updateModel(
        uint256 tokenId, 
        string calldata modelHash,
        string calldata modelType
    ) 
        external
    {
        require(usedModels[modelHash] == false, "Model already used");
        usedModels[modelHash] = true;
        require(msg.sender == ownerOf(tokenId));
        fighters[tokenId].modelHash = modelHash;
        fighters[tokenId].modelType = modelType;
```
