# Deploy script forget to call `setUnboundedKerosineVault()` on `BoundedKerosineVault.sol`

`setUnboundedKerosineVault()` should be called on deployment.

## Impact

`BoundedKerosineVault.assetPrice()` call always revert.
Preventing user from using KEROSENE as collateral to mint DYAD.

If user add KerosineVault as collateral, it also affect withdrawal/minting DYAD tokens of other vaults too as collateral calculation will revert.

Admin can fix this later by call `setUnboundedKerosineVault()` on `BoundedKerosineVault.sol`.

## Proof of Concept

variable `unboundedKerosineVault` address is still empty value. It should be set to `UnboundedKerosineVault` address during deployment.
`VaultManagerV2` loop through all active vault and call `assetPrice()` on each vault to calculate total asset price.
If this function does not work, collateral calculation will fail. This affect Withdrawal and Minting functions.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Call `setUnboundedKerosineVault()` on `BoundedKerosineVault.sol` during deployment.

```solidity
    UnboundedKerosineVault unboundedKerosineVault = new UnboundedKerosineVault(
      vaultManager,
      Kerosine(MAINNET_KEROSENE), 
      Dyad    (MAINNET_DYAD),
      kerosineManager
    );

    BoundedKerosineVault boundedKerosineVault     = new BoundedKerosineVault(
      vaultManager,
      Kerosine(MAINNET_KEROSENE), 
      kerosineManager
    );

    KerosineDenominator kerosineDenominator       = new KerosineDenominator(
      Kerosine(MAINNET_KEROSENE)
    );
+++    boundedKerosineVault.setUnboundedKerosineVault(unboundedKerosineVault);
    unboundedKerosineVault.setDenominator(kerosineDenominator);

    unboundedKerosineVault.transferOwnership(MAINNET_OWNER);
    boundedKerosineVault.  transferOwnership(MAINNET_OWNER);
```
