  15 |     |  * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.

  18 |     |  * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
  19 |     |  * to implement supply mechanisms].

  21 |     |  * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override
  22 |     |  * this function so it returns a different value.
  23 |     |  *
  24 |     |  * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
  25 |     |  * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
  26 |     |  * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
  27 |     |  * applications.
  28 |     |  *
  29 |     |  * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
  30 |     |  * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
  31 |     |  * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
  32 |     |  * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
  33 |     |  *
  34 |     |  * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

  15 |     |  *
  16 |     |  * Strings of arbitrary length can be optimized using this library if
  17 |     |  * they are short enough (up to 31 bytes) by packing them with their

  19 |     |  * fallback mechanism can be used for every other case.
  20 |     |  *
  21 |     |  * Usage example:
  22 |     |  *
  23 |     |  * ```solidity
  24 |     |  * contract Named {
  25 |     |  *     using ShortStrings for *;
  26 |     |  *
  27 |     |  *     ShortString private immutable _name;
