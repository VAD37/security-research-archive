# Live Config Issue: Offer Updates Don't Immediately Check Config Validity, Potentially Causing Opportunity Costs

## Summary

The Collar Project uses `ConfigHub` as a live configuration singleton.
Provider offers can become invalid if configurations are updated.
However, providers can still deposit new funds into these invalid offers. This creates an opportunity cost for providers, as they remain unaware their offers are no longer acceptable.

## Finding Description

In `CollarProviderNFT.sol`, there is no frontend view function to validate offers against the current config.

While offer parameters are validated upon acceptance [(ref)](https://github.com/CollarNetworks/protocol-core/blob/3eadf114e72ff49b3096c221f0d8d31951a38292/src/CollarProviderNFT.sol#L240-L241), this validation also absent during offer creation and when depositing additional funds into existing offers ([ref1](https://github.com/CollarNetworks/protocol-core/blob/3eadf114e72ff49b3096c221f0d8d31951a38292/src/CollarProviderNFT.sol#L154-L179), [ref2](https://github.com/CollarNetworks/protocol-core/blob/3eadf114e72ff49b3096c221f0d8d31951a38292/src/CollarProviderNFT.sol#L199-L202)).

## Impact Explanation

Providers can unknowingly create "ghost offers" that hold funds but cannot be accepted.
This leads to wasted time and extra steps for providers, representing an opportunity cost.
Severity: Medium (Low if manual checks are implemented on the frontend).

## Likelihood Explanation

For example, if the protocol increases the minimum offer duration from 5 minutes to 6 hours, providers might deposit funds into old offers with a 1-hour duration, unaware they are no longer valid. These offers would then remain unfulfilled.

## Proof of Concept (if required)

## Recommendation

Implement a universal view function to validate offers against the latest config. This would simplify both the frontend DApp and the provider experience.
