# Using Uniswap Pool as Participation Address to DoS Campaign Rewards

An exploiter can repeatedly claim rewards with a minimal deposit by using a Uniswap pool as the `Participation.userAddress`—effectively freezing the campaign rewards at no cost. (Also work with other flashloan service like AAVE)

## Finding description and impact

The vulnerability stems from the offchain operator’s reliance on token balance checks before invalidating participations. When a Uniswap pool address participates, it is always seen as having sufficient token balance during the escrow period.

This causes the offchain bot to never invalidate the participation, even though the pool cannot actually claim rewards. As a result, all rewards remain stuck in the pending pool.

This exploit works with Uniswap V2, V3, and V4 pool addresses, because the exploiter can later retrieve their original deposit to secure the rewards:

- UniswapV2: Pool `skim()` function retrieves tokens that are not part of the core pool balance.
- UniswapV3: Flashloan mechanisms allow draining tokens and returning them during the Li.Fi reallocation process.
- AAVE: just flashloan and then refund as last part of Li.Fi executor multicall

### Impact

- DoS on Campaigns: The exploit locks campaign rewards indefinitely until an admin intervenes.
- Reward Fees lost: Nudge Protocol take 10% reward fee directly. Campaign Manager loses the ability to withdraw pending rewards. It is recoverable by Nudge Admin but it might not be honorable.
- Repeatable Abuse: The exploit can be repeated continuously, DOS entire project until new upgrade.

## Proof of Concept

This POC only show exploiter can move all rewards to pending participants with only a small balance.

POC do not include full fork test with UniswapV2. So here are some minor change for fork POC to work:
- Replacing the `handleReallocation()` user address with a Uniswap V2 pair (which holds a large amount of `targetToken`), then
- Invoking `UniswapV2Pair.skim()` to reclaim the deposit tokens, the process can be repeated until all campaign rewards are drained.

## Recommended mitigation steps

- Adhoc solution: Restrict Participation to EOAs using `tx.origin`. Contract code check can still be exploited.
- Blacklisting known exploited contract addresses, as this exploit could also be replicated across cross-chain services.
- Modify the fee collection process so that fees are deducted only during reward claims
