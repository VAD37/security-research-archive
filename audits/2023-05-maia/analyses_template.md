# Analyses: Guidelines and FAQ

**⚠️ Currently, Analyses cannot be edited after submitting. We suggest saving your work locally until you’re ready to submit your final draft.**

## What is an analysis?

An analysis is a written submission outlining:

- Your analysis of the codebase as a whole and any observations or advice you have about architecture, mechanism, or approach
- Broader concerns like systemic risks or centralization risks
- The approach you took in reviewing the code
- New insights and learnings from this audit

## Why submit an analysis?

Analyses are your best opportunity to provide the contest sponsor with valuable insights that go beyond any single vulnerability and extend to securing their codebase as a whole. Accordingly, the Analysis award pool is typically 7.5% of the total award pool.

In addition to financial incentives:
- Performance within advanced analyses will soon become a criteria for selection in an increasing number of opportunities, including ALL mitigation reviews, shortlist invitationals, and some other not-yet-announced offerings.
- Newer wardens submit 90% of spam and low-quality submissions and inherently are subject to greater scrutiny as a result. Choosing and providing a quality basic analysis provides greater motivation for lookouts/judges to spend more time reviewing the validity of your submissions.

## 📝 Questions to answer in your analysis

You are asked to choose either a “Basic” level or “Advanced,” based on your honest self-assessment of your skill level and the depth of analysis you performed. The advanced analysis allows wardens to provide a high level architectural review and codebase analysis as well as recommendations — and to win a slice of the pool based on their analyses.

After selecting the appropriate level, a set of questions will appear on the submission form, for you to answer to the best of your ability.

### Basic
- What did you learn from reviewing this codebase? Be specific.
- What approach did you take in evaluating this codebase in order to help you grow your skills and code review resources?
- How much time did you spend?

### Advanced
- Analysis of the codebase (What's unique? What's using existing patterns?)
- Architecture feedback
- Centralization risks
- Systemic risks
- Other recommendations
- How much time did you spend?

## 🧑‍⚖️ Judging and Awarding

All analyses will be graded A/B/C, similarly to Gas and QA reports. C is an unsatisfactory grade. A “best” analysis will be selected by the judge.

### Awarding

Basic analyses are not eligible for the Analysis award pool (typically 5% of the total pool). However, submitting a quality basic-level analysis provides greater motivation for lookouts/judges to spend more time reviewing the validity of your submissions.

Advanced analyses graded A or B will be awarded from the Analysis award pool. The best advanced analysis gets a 30% bonus.

### ❓ FAQ

- Can I see an example of an analysis?
  - This is a new experiment at Code4rena, so we don’t have examples to share yet. Just make a genuine effort to answer the questions, and when A+ analyses are published, we’ll share them here.

- Where is the submission form?
  - The submission form is scheduled to go live June 6, 2023. C4 staff will post an update to all relevant contest channels when it is available.

- I’m a non-native English speaker. Will I be penalized for language differences?
  - As with all Code4rena submissions, judges are asked to assess

 analyses based on their content; we aren’t looking for perfect grammar. That being said, if you prefer, you may submit your analysis in another language, and C4’s judge and lookout will use translation tools to read it. When possible, we will pull in Judges and Lookouts who speak the language.

- Are analyses a part of all Code4rena audits?
  - Not quite yet, but we expect they will be a core feature of all Code4rena audits in the near future. For now, you can tell which audits have Analyses by looking at the award pool details in:
    - the #rsvp channel in the Code4rena Discord server,
    - the audit repo, or
    - the audit page on the Code4rena.com website.

- What if I have a limited amount of time to spend on an audit, but still want to submit a finding? Is there still value in submitting an analysis?
  - Yes. You can simply state in your analysis that you spent a limited amount of time with the code base. Even a brief analysis helps Lookouts and Judges understand your approach and perspective.
