# DOS queue execution by set token receiver to ERC20 blacklist address

Most of ERC20 stable coin like USDC,USDT have custom blacklist on mainnet and L2 network.
Any token send to this address will revert.

Because `AccountingManager` vault queue execution is unskipable, attacker can just deposit/withdraw token to blacklist address to DOS the vault.

## Impact

Permanent DOS on `AccountingManager` execution queue. Require emergency rescue to fix.

## Proof of Concept

USDC blacklist address on mainnet is really active.

In Withdrawal while loop, there is no token failed transfer check nor anyway for vault manager skip a broken queue.

So if `baseToken.safeTransfer()` [revert here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-noya/blob/9c79b332eff82011dcfa1e8fd51bad805159d758/contracts/accountingManager/AccountingManager.sol#L427). The whole withdrawal queue will be paused forever.

## Tools Used

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Vault Manager should have abilities to skip queue and refund user token if transfer failed.
