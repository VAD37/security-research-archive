# `AccountingManager` revert when mint to zero address. Deposit/Withdraw queue accept `address(0)` as receiver. DOS queue execution

OpenZeppelin ERC20 revert when mint(), transfer() target is `address(0)`.
It not possible for vault manager to skip failed deposit/withdraw execution and continue with next user in queue.

## Impact

Permanent DOS on `AccountingManager`. Require emergency rescue to fix.

## Proof of Concept

In OZ ERC20, it throw error when mint() or transfer() target is `address(0)`.

User vault deposit and withdraw have no check for `receiver != address(0)`.

It just add directly to queue.

And Vault Admin must run call queue execution manually and cannot skip failed execution.
Deposit will failed during `_mint()`.

Withdrawal fail during transfer().token back to receiver.

## Tools Used

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Abilities to try/catch queue execution and refund user would be nice to have.
Otherwise, have zero address validation.
