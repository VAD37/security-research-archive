# Inflation Attack: Validator can abuse 0.1% slashing mechanism to inflate exchange rate early on to steal staking deposit from user

## Summary

Validator EOA themself is **untrusted**. Have good incentive to intentionally get themselves slashing penaties of <0.1% of total staking balance.

Validator can then following ERC4626 inflation attack pattern, inflating HYPE:kHYPE exchange rate from 1:1 to 1:1000 by using minimum deposit 1e18 HYPE reduced to smaller value by slashing penaties.
Minting free kHYPE.
New deposit of HYPE from other users will slowly restore exchange rate back to 1:1.
Validator can then selloff their own kHYPE and steal staking deposit from other user.

## Impact

## Finding description and impact

Validator must have minimum 10,000 HYPE staking balance.
L2 EVM `StakingManager` is just additional delegate on top of this balance and the minimum deposit/delegate is 1 HYPE on L2.

During early period of `StakingManager` when it still have small deposit balance
