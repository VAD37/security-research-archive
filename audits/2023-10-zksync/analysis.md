## notes

- zkSync is not full solidity compatible. It convert to LLVM.
- double check precompiled contract
- everycontract is EOA. it can send transaction natively. So unique contract abilities for L2 contract.
- all account is a smart contract.
- nonce transaction does not exist. It is random when send at the same time.
